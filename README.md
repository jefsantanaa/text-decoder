## Project Description

**Text Decoder** is a responsive website designed to create and register decoded texts. This project was developed as part of a challenge in the course [ONE (Oracle Next Education)](https://www.oracle.com/br/education/oracle-next-education/) in partnership with [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/). Using technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, Text Decoder offers a simple and intuitive interface to efficiently decode texts.

## Features and Application Demo

- **Decoding Form**: The project includes a form on the left side of the screen where users can input the text to be decoded into a textarea.
- **Decode Button**: After entering the text, users can click the "Decode Text" button. The decoded text will then be displayed in a section on the right side of the screen.
- **Undo Decode Button**: After decoding, an "Undo Decode" button appears below the decode button in the form, allowing users to reverse the process.
- **Copy Decoded Text Button**: Below the section where the decoded text is displayed, there is a button that allows users to copy the decoded text to the clipboard.
- **Text Limit in Section**: The section displaying the decoded texts can hold up to 3 texts simultaneously.

## Project Access

Text Decoder will be accessible through a dedicated page created using GitHub Pages.
